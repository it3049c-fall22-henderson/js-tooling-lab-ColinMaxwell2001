## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 15. I was able to do all parts successfully except for part 4. It keeps telling me that cypress has timed out. 

## Self-Reflection:
This assignment was a little difficult, I had a really hard time with the unit tests, but once I figured it out, I had to laugh at myself because the solution was in front of me the entire time since you had already written one of them. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
2 hours.
